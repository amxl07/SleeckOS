Update the SleeckOS single-page site: replace the existing "Courses" heading with a modern, interactive Courses module that lists Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), and Level 3 (L3) and supports selectable sub-courses and dynamic pricing. Output production-ready HTML/CSS/JS (single-page integration or separate files) with clear comments and a small README header describing customization.

Requirements:

1. Structure & Content
- Replace the Courses section heading with: "Courses — L1 • L2 • L3".
- Include three primary cards (L1, L2, L3). Each card shows:
  - Level title (L1 / L2 / L3)
  - Short tagline
  - Base price (editable)
  - Duration
  - Expand/Collapse control to show sub-courses
- Populate sub-courses from provided content:
  - L1 sub-courses: AI Fundamentals; Working with LLMs; Simple Generative Tasks; AI Tools & Apps; Ethics & Safety.
  - L2 sub-courses: Programming with AI (Python intro); Chatbots & RAG; Advanced Prompting & Automation; AI Agents (Intro); Monetization Skills; Guest Webinars.
  - L3 sub-courses: Advanced Agents & LangChain; Custom LLMs & RAG Pipelines; AI in Business & Innovation; Performance Evaluation & Hiring.
- Each sub-course entry must include: title, 1-line description, duration (e.g., 2–4 hours), optional icon, and a checkbox to include/exclude from package.

2. Pricing & Dynamic Calculator (NO PAYMENT)
- Show editable base price for each level (defaults: L1 ₹7,500; L2 ₹25,000; L3 ₹45,000 — editable in code).
- Each sub-course can have an adjustable add-on price. Selecting checkboxes updates a visible “Package Summary” panel in real-time:
  - Items listed (selected level + sub-courses)
  - Subtotal, discount (if multiple selections — e.g., 10% bundle discount, configurable), estimated total.
- No payment/checkout integration. “Enroll / Request Info” button opens a pre-filled mailto: link (or shows a contact modal) with a summary of selections.

3. UX / UI Behavior
- Cards animate gently on expand/collapse (150–320ms). Sub-course checkboxes animate micro-interactions.
- Desktop layout: course cards left; sticky summary panel on the right. Mobile: cards stacked, summary appears as bottom sheet/modal.
- Persist user selections in localStorage so returning visitors see prior selections.
- Add a “Reset selections” control.

4. Accessibility & Intl
- Fully keyboard accessible (tab order, Enter/Space toggles).
- Proper semantic markup and aria attributes: expanded/collapsed states, aria-live region for price updates, aria-labels for controls.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: disable non-essential animations if set.
- Add a language toggle placeholder (EN / മലയാളം) near the section heading. The content may remain English but must be structured so translations can be inserted easily; include data attributes for translation keys.

5. Visual & Theming
- Keep the site’s dark-minimal aesthetic (black background, white/gray text, subtle accents). Ensure high contrast for readability and accessible font sizes.
- Use subtle glass-card effects and hover micro-interactions consistent with SleeckOS design.
- Keep JS minimal and performant (no heavy frameworks). Inline critical CSS; lazy-load non-critical assets. Aim JS < 40KB minified (excluding fonts).

6. Integration with hidden signature (no conflict)
- Ensure constellation/hero signature feature (Interactive Constellation Reveal) remains functional and unaffected.
- The Course module must not overlay or interrupt the hero reveal interactions. If the reveal is active, the course summary should remain visible and accessible.

7. Developer/Customization Notes
- Include comments at top of files explaining where to change: base prices, per-subcourse price, discount rule, durations, language strings, and contact mailto target.
- Provide a small README comment header describing delivered files, how to edit prices, and how to toggle enabling/disabling localStorage persistence.

8. Deliverables
- Updated HTML/CSS/JS files integrated into the existing single-page layout (or a single self-contained HTML file plus separate CSS/JS if preferred).
- Inline comments and a README header describing customization and accessibility fallbacks.

Acceptance criteria:
- On load, the Courses section shows L1/L2/L3 cards with base prices and an unobtrusive hint: "Select sub-courses to customize your package. Pricing updates live."
- Selecting sub-courses updates the summary panel and subtotal/total correctly.
- Enroll/Request Info opens a prefilled email or modal (no payment).
- Works responsively and is keyboard accessible. Respect reduced-motion settings.

Use the course descriptions above for sub-course copy and keep the tone aligned with SleeckOS: professional, motivating, and concise.
