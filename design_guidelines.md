## Visual Treatment

**Professional Minimalism:**
- High contrast for accessibility (white on black)
- Generous whitespace for breathing room
- Sharp, clean lines with subtle rounded corners (4-6px)
- Focus on typography hierarchy over decorative elements

**Interactive Feedback:**
- Subtle hover states that don't distract
- Smooth transitions (300ms duration)
- Visual feedback for clickable elements

## Content Structure

**Homepage Sections:**
1. Hero: Company name, tagline, mission (single viewport)
2. Overview: Brief SleeckOS description
3. Courses: Grid layout of course offerings
4. Footer: Minimal contact/links

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Course grid: 1 column (mobile) â†’ 2-3 columns (desktop)
- Typography scales appropriately across breakpoints
- Touch-friendly interactive elements (44px minimum)

## Images
**Minimal Image Usage:**
- Optional course icons: Simple line icons or tech symbols
- No large hero images - focus on typography and clean layout
- If icons used: Monochrome white/gray to maintain aesthetic
- Course placeholders: Abstract geometric shapes or tech-related iconography

This design prioritizes readability, professionalism, and modern web aesthetics while maintaining the requested dark theme and minimalist approach.
